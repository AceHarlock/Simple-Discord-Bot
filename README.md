# How to Make a Discord Bot in the Developer Portal?

Before you can dive into any Python code to handle events and create exciting automations, you need to first create a few Discord components:

1. An account
2. An application
3. A bot
4. A guild
You’ll learn more about each piece in the following sections.

Once you’ve created all of these components, you’ll tie them together by registering your bot with your guild.

You can get started by heading to Discord’s Developer Portal.

<b>Creating a Discord Account</b>
The first thing you’ll see is a landing page where you’ll need to either login, if you have an existing account, or create a new account:

If you need to create a new account, then click on the Register button below Login and enter your account information.
Once you’re finished, you’ll be redirected to the Developer Portal home page, where you’ll create your application.

<b>Creating Application</b>
An application allows you to interact with Discord’s APIs by providing authentication tokens, designating permissions, and so on.

To create a new application, select New Application:
